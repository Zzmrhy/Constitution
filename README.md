Welcome to the monstrosity of a site called the DOBA Site (to be thought out further)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is a website that uses an old constitution my lab has made for someone in our first year at tech (appears in the rules page) and it has been made into something far worse than before but it's worth making.
The project was originally made in ReactJS but was swapped over to an EJS page for better performance (recommended from both my teacher and classmate to have it done in EJS)
